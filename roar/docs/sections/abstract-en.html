<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
Ontology to describe person, location etc. observations in archival resources. One or multiple observations can be bundled into a reconstruction that combines complementary (or sometimes conflicting) information from the observation(s) so that a single entity is reconstructed out of several entity observations from one or multiple sources.</span>
