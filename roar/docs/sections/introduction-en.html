<p>Most archivists will tell you they make indexes, not identifications - which makes sense. But often researchers, genealogists, and sometimes even archivists want to reconstruct lives (or places) from the available sources. We designed the roar ontology to do both.</p>

<p>On the one hand, roar will let you describe the people and places you find in a specific document. Each person and place mentioned in the document is an <em>observation</em>, that can be used as a piece of the puzzle later on. The observations, of course, help create indexes right away.</p>

<p>On the other, roar lets you make reconstructions - the puzzle put together. A <em>person reconstruction</em> can be derived from observations in a birth certificate, a notary deed, a newspaper article, a diary and even a photograph.</p>

<p>Reconstructions can be made manually, but also in an automated process. When using algorithms, changing parameters can even result in multiple reconstructions for different purposes of the same person or location. With the prov ontology you may annotate who made what reconstruction when, and wich software or parameters where used in doing so.</p></span>
