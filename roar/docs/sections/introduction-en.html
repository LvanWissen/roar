<p>Most modern archivists will tell you they create indexes (with the help of volunteers), not identifications. Which
    makes sense. But often researchers, genealogists, and sometimes even archivists want to reconstruct lives (or
    places) from the available sources. We designed the roar ontology to facilitate all.</p>

<p>On the one hand, roar will let you describe the people and places you find in a specific document. Each person and
    place mentioned in the document is an <em>observation</em>, that can be used as a piece of the puzzle later on. The
    observations, of course, help create indexes right away.</p>

<p>On the other, roar lets you describe reconstructions - the puzzle put together. A <em>person reconstruction</em> can
    be derived from observations in a birth certificate, a notary deed, a newspaper article, a diary or a photograph. A
    reconstruction always links to all observations.</p>

<p>Reconstructions can be made manually, but also in an automated process. When using algorithms, changing parameters
    could even result in multiple reconstructions for different purposes of the same person or location. With the prov
    ontology you may annotate who made what reconstruction when, and which software or parameters where used in doing
    so.</p>
